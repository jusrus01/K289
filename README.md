## Jira workflow idea
1. Before starting a sprint, review how user stories are formulated and make required changes.
2. Try to assign front-end developer and back-end developer to the same story, to avoid full stack work.
3. Create subtasks for selected story to see progress of the back-end and front-end.
4. Decide on the contract between two people, e.g. the end-point that will be created and what kind of json object it will return. Furthermore, front-end developer should work with mocked data, if the back-end is not available yet. Moreover, front-end should be merged to the project using the real end-point even if back-end is not yet finished (unless the back-end developer will not be able to finish his work during the sprint).
